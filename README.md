# Problems-on-Graphs
# Graph Algorithms 

## Overview
This project implements various graph algorithms on the given weighted undirected graph. The source node is **'A'** and the target node is **'F'**. The following problems are solved:

1. **Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)** - Find the shortest path from 'A' to 'F'.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Implement BFS traversal.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Implement DFS traversal.
4. **Cycle Detection** - Detect if the graph contains a cycle.
5. **Graph Coloring** - Color the graph using at most 3 colors ensuring no adjacent nodes have the same color.

## Problem 1: Shortest Path (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)
**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize all node distances to infinity except the source node ('A'), which is set to 0.
2. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to process nodes with the smallest distance.
3. Update adjacent nodes with the minimum distance.
4. Continue until the shortest path to the target node ('F') is found.

**Time Complexity:** O((V+E) log V)

## Problem 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
**Algorithm:**
1. Start at node 'A' and add it to a queue.
2. Process each node and enqueue its unvisited neighbors.
3. Continue until all nodes are visited.

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

## Problem 3: Depth-First Search (DFS)
**Algorithm:**
1. Start at node 'A'.
2. Use recursion (or a stack) to explore each node deeply before backtracking.
3. Visit all nodes.

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

---

## Problem 4: Cycle Detection (DFS Approach)
**Algorithm:**
1. Perform DFS while keeping track of visited nodes and their parent.
2. If a visited node is encountered that is **not the parent**, a cycle exists.
3. Check all nodes to ensure the entire graph is processed.

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

## Problem 5: Graph Coloring (Greedy Algorithm)
**Algorithm:**
1. Assign colors to nodes ensuring that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
2. Use a greedy approach, picking the smallest available color.
3. Use at most **3 colors**.

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
